Tasks completed:

Everything required. I.e.:
* Part 1: Coordinate transform
* Part 2: Implementing Phong Reflectance
* Part 3: Normal mapping
* Part 4: Adding Environment Lighting
* Part 5: Adding Spotlights and Shadows

Alterations:
In part 5.2 where mesh.ccp is to "pass an array of matrices to 
the shader to go from object space to the "light space" for each 
spot light," I couldn't figure out how to make a matrix going from
the [-w, w]^3 space to [0, 1]^3 space, so I instead followed the
method on learnopengl.com's shadow mapping tutorial where I sent
the WORLD space to light space matrices then converted the object
space vtx_position to world space then used that passed in matrix
to convert it to light space in the vertex shader. Maybe the
performance differs, but the end data conversion is the same so
the rendered image looks the same.
